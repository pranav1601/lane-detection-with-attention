## Lane Detection using attention.

* This repository contains the notebook `lane_detector.ipynb` that analyses two models - the UNet and a custom UNet. The Custom Unet utilizes residual blocks and attention to focus on more important features of the image.

* you can access the Unet model and the custom UNet model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XCYvkpXMAJv_PsZzAiRw6lUKici_KkGE/view?usp=sharing). Feel free to try them out

* you can access the output videos [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vjg4G92qZaNwPObSyxzSXnLtLEDfqt3j/view?usp=sharing)
